    <h1>Windshield wipers are a necessary safety feature to any car. The problem is that they don't last forever - but rather need replacing every few years. The rubber blades dry out over time due to use and the sun. How can you tell that you need new wipers? They'll exhibit some of the following symptoms:</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Streaking water</li>
        <li>Squeaky</li>
        <li>Leave a milky film when wiping</li>
        <li>Any other reason it seems your wipers aren't performing well</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before buying new wipers, try simply wiping the dirt and hardened rubber off your blades with a wet rag. Sometimes you can get some more life out of them this way.</p>
